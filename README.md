## PC Study 
**Code:** ["Contentious Debate in Higher Education Surrounding Political Correctness:A Multi-Perspective Study"]()
**Description:** 
In Western circles, political correctness (PC) has become a hot topic of debate among both students and scholars. Some believe their right to free speech and upholding the integrity of scientific excellence is at stake, while others believe PC is necessary to minimize social inequity and change negative biases towards marginalized groups. To better understand how political correctness has influenced peopleâ€™s attitudes, this study investigates the association between concern for political correctness (CPC), tolerance of ambiguity (TOA), and concept creep (CC), and how demographic variables could moderate this relationship. A total of 111 participants completed a survey testing for CPC, TOA, and CC, and various demographic questions. 

**Skills:**
**Technology:**


**Results:**
Preliminary analyses revealed that CPC was correlated with a higher likelihood of defining various social situations as traumatic or bullying. Additionally, those who identified as LGBTQIA were more likely to engage in CPC than straight individuals.
